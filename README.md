# ZTM-Tensorflow
📘 TensorFlow Deep Learning Bootcamp – My Study Notes

This repo contains all the study notes, implementations, and exercises I prepared while following the Udemy course [TensorFlow for Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery).

My goal is not just to watch and move on,
but to rewrite, experiment with, and develop all the content with my own commentary to build a solid foundation in deep learning.
