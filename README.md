# TensorFlow for Deep Learning Bootcamp

📘 Learn TensorFlow by Google. Become an AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning expert!

This repo contains all the study notes, implementations, and exercises I prepared while following the [TensorFlow for Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery) on Udemy.

**My goal:** Not just to watch and move on, but to rewrite, experiment with, and develop all the content with my own commentary to build a solid foundation in deep learning.
